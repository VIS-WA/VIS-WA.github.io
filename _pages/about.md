Hello! 👋 I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. Ambuj Varshney. My research focuses on the intersection of foundational models and sensor networks, with the goal of enabling the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained IoT devices 🌐📲.

## Current Projects

1. LLMs for embedded sensing
2. RAILS - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Learning Systems
