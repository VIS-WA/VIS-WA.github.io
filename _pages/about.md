Hello! 👋 I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. **Ambuj Varshney** ([https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ambuj/](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ambuj/)). I explore how **next-gen embedded tags** are evolving toward architectures that emphasize **local processing** and **peer-to-peer coordination** for **energy-sustainable** operation at scale. My work also examines how **smaller foundational models** enable practical **on-device AI** in highly constrained **IoT** environments 🌐📲.

## Current Projects

1. Multi-Microcontroller Platforms (RAILS)
2. LLMs for the Edge ([TinyLLM](https://github.com/weiserlab/TinyLLM))
3. Low-power Tag-to-Tag Networks
