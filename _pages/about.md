Hello! 👋 I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. Ambuj Varshney. My research 🔍 focuses on the intersection of foundational models and sensor networks, with the goal of enabling the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained IoT devices 🌐📲.
